# CV Analysis Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented LLM-powered CV analysis to enhance the "Jobs For You" recommendation algorithm. The system extracts skills, experience level, and industries from user CVs using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model.

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Schema Updates
- **File**: `src/extensions/users-permissions/content-types/user/schema.json`
- **Change**: Added `cvAnalysis` JSON field to store analysis results

### 2. CV Analysis Service
- **File**: `src/services/cvAnalysisService.ts` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
  - Structured prompt engineering for consistent extraction
  - Token optimization (~1,200-3,000 tokens per analysis)
  - Timeout handling (30s max)
  - Graceful error handling
  - Confidence scoring

### 3. CV Upload Integration
- **File**: `src/api/profile/controllers/profile.ts`
- **Change**: Modified `linkCv` endpoint to trigger async CV analysis after text extraction
- **Features**:
  - Non-blocking analysis (upload completes regardless of LLM success)
  - Comprehensive logging
  - Graceful degradation

### 4. Enhanced Recommendation Algorithm
- **File**: `src/api/job/controllers/job.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `recommendations` endpoint to use CV analysis data
  - Enhanced `score` function with CV-based scoring
  - Added `experienceMatch` scoring component
  - Improved skills matching with confidence boosting
  - Added helper functions: `overlapWithConfidence`, `getExperienceMatchScore`

### 5. Database Migration
- **File**: `database/migrations/2025.01.20T12.00.00.add_cv_analysis.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Adds `cv_analysis` JSONB column to `up_users` table
  - Creates GIN index for efficient querying

### 6. Test Script
- **File**: `test-cv-analysis.js`
- **Purpose**: Test CV analysis functionality with sample CV

## Key Features Implemented

### CV Analysis Extraction
- **Skills**: 5-15 most relevant technical and soft skills
- **Experience Level**: intern/junior/mid/senior/unknown based on CV content
- **Industries**: 2-5 industry domains the person has worked in
- **Confidence**: 0.0-1.0 quality score based on CV clarity

### Enhanced Scoring
- **Skills Matching**: Uses CV-extracted skills with confidence boosting
- **Experience Matching**: Intelligent filtering based on experience level hierarchy
- **Fallback**: Gracefully falls back to user preferences if CV analysis unavailable

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if LLM analysis fails
- **Async Processing**: Analysis doesn't block CV upload
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations logged for monitoring
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests

## Cost Analysis
- **Per Analysis**: $0.0003 - $0.0015 (0.03-0.15 cents)
- **Monthly Estimate**: $0.60 - $3.00 for 1,000 users uploading 2 CVs each
- **Token Usage**: ~1,200-3,000 tokens per CV analysis

## Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Ensure these environment variables are set:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
CV_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true
CV_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT=30000
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the migration to add the cvAnalysis column:
```bash
npm run strapi db:migrate
```

### 3. Testing
Test the CV analysis service:
```bash
# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Test CV analysis
node test-cv-analysis.js
```

### 4. Deployment
1. Deploy with `CV_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=false` initially
2. Test with internal accounts
3. Monitor logs and costs for 24-48 hours
4. Enable for all users: `CV_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true`
5. Monitor recommendation engagement metrics

## Monitoring & Success Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- % of users with analyzed CVs
- CV analysis success rate
- Token usage and costs
- Job recommendation click-through rate improvement
- User satisfaction with "Jobs For You" tab

### Log Messages to Monitor
- `[cvAnalysis] Analysis completed and saved for user X`
- `[cvAnalysis] Analysis failed for user X`
- `[recommendations] CV analysis available: true/false`

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Analysis runs asynchronously (non-blocking)
- Only runs 1-4 times per user per month
- Includes retry logic and timeout handling
- Uses efficient JSONB storage with GIN indexing

### Security
- No CV text is logged (only analysis results)
- OpenAI API key properly secured in environment variables
- Graceful handling of API failures

### Scalability
- Designed to handle high volume of CV uploads
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Cost-effective token usage with smart prompt engineering

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Analysis not running**: Check `CV_ANALYSIS_ENABLED` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. **High costs**: Monitor token usage, consider prompt optimization
3. **Poor analysis quality**: Review prompt engineering, adjust confidence thresholds
4. **Database errors**: Ensure migration ran successfully, check cvAnalysis column

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if CV analysis is working
node test-cv-analysis.js

# View recent logs
tail -f logs/strapi.log | grep cvAnalysis

# Check database schema
psql -d your_db -c "\d up_users"
```
