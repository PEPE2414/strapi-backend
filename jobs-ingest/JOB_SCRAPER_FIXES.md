# Job Scraper Fixes & Optimizations

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. TypeScript Syntax Error
- **File**: `src/sources/jobBoards.ts`
- **Issue**: Missing closing brace on line 167
- **Fix**: Added proper brace closure and fixed indentation

### 2. Sitemap Discovery Failures
- **File**: `src/sources/sitemapDiscovery.ts`
- **Issue**: Too restrictive URL filtering requiring both job keywords AND UK location in URLs
- **Fix**: 
  - Relaxed filtering logic to prioritize job relevance over URL location keywords
  - Added explicit exclusion of non-UK job boards (indeed.com, monster.com, etc.)
  - Made UK location requirement optional for job board URLs

### 3. 403 Errors & Anti-Bot Detection
- **File**: `src/lib/fetcher.ts`
- **Issue**: Single user-agent and insufficient retry logic for 403 errors
- **Fix**:
  - Added user-agent rotation with 5 different realistic user agents
  - Enhanced headers to mimic real browser requests
  - Improved retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
  - Special handling for 403 (10-15s delays) and 429 (rate limiting) errors
  - Added 30-second timeout for requests

### 4. Job Board Scraper Strategy
- **File**: `src/sources/jobBoards.ts`
- **Issue**: Poor error handling and insufficient delays between requests
- **Fix**:
  - Added try-catch around sitemap discovery
  - Increased delays between requests (2-3 seconds with jitter)
  - Better error logging and graceful degradation

## New Optimizations ðŸš€

### 5. Optimized Job Board Scraper
- **File**: `src/sources/optimizedJobBoards.ts` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - Focuses on high-volume, reliable sources (Indeed UK, Reed, TotalJobs, CV Library)
  - Multiple selector fallbacks for each job board
  - Specialized scraping logic per job board type
  - Better job data extraction with multiple fallback selectors
  - Increased limits: 20 jobs from Indeed, 15 from others

### 6. Enhanced Rotation Strategy
- **File**: `src/lib/rotation.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Prioritizes optimized job boards as secondary sources
  - Relegates working job boards to tertiary priority
  - Maintains focus on known working ATS sources first

### 7. Updated Main Orchestration
- **File**: `src/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added support for `optimized-boards` source
  - Integrated new optimized job board scraper

## Expected Results ðŸ“Š

### Before Fixes:
- Job board scrapers returning 0 jobs due to 403 errors
- Sitemap discovery failing due to overly restrictive filtering
- TypeScript compilation errors

### After Fixes:
- **Increased Job Discovery**: Optimized scrapers should find 100-500+ jobs per run
- **Better Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- **Reduced Blocking**: User-agent rotation and realistic headers
- **Improved Success Rate**: Multiple selector fallbacks and specialized logic

## Current Rotation Strategy

### Primary Sources (Daily):
- **21 Working ATS Sources**: Greenhouse (Stripe, Airbnb, Spotify, etc.) + Lever (Canva, Notion, etc.)
- Expected: 500-2000 jobs per run

### Secondary Sources:
- **Optimized Job Boards**: Indeed UK, Reed, TotalJobs, CV Library
- Expected: 100-500 jobs per run

### Tertiary Sources:
- **Working Job Boards**: Individual scrapers for reliable sources
- **University Job Boards**: Gradcracker, Joblift, etc.

## Target Goals ðŸŽ¯

- **Primary Goal**: 10,000+ jobs found, 1,000+ valid UK jobs per run
- **Secondary Goal**: 1+ hour runtime acceptable for quality/quantity
- **Focus**: Job boards covering multiple companies vs individual company pages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Optimized Scrapers First**: Run `optimized-boards` source to verify job discovery
2. **Monitor 403 Errors**: Watch for reduced blocking with new user-agent rotation
3. **Validate Job Quality**: Ensure UK filtering and student relevance still work
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure job discovery rates and runtime

## Next Steps

1. Deploy fixes to staging environment
2. Run test scraping session with optimized sources
3. Monitor logs for 403 errors and job discovery rates
4. Fine-tune delays and retry logic based on results
5. Scale up to full rotation if successful

## Files Modified

- `src/sources/jobBoards.ts` - Fixed syntax errors, improved error handling
- `src/sources/sitemapDiscovery.ts` - Relaxed URL filtering logic
- `src/lib/fetcher.ts` - Enhanced anti-detection and retry logic
- `src/sources/optimizedJobBoards.ts` - NEW optimized scraper
- `src/lib/rotation.ts` - Updated rotation strategy
- `src/index.ts` - Integrated optimized scraper

All changes maintain backward compatibility and include comprehensive error handling.
